## Introduction

The purpose of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) effort is to establish and document rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These test rules address automated, semi-automated, and manual testing. The ACT Task Force aims to make accessibility testing transparent, and thus minimize confusion caused by different interpretations of accessibility guidelines.

## Who ACT is for

The primary audience of Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) is developers of accessibility evaluation methodologies and tools. They implement ACT Rules into their products and services. ACT serves as documentation and requirements.

A secondary audience is accessibility experts. They often assist in setting an organization's accessibility policy, and it is important for them to know what the rules do.

Who ACT is **not** for: Users of accessibility tools (web developers, content authors, QA testers, etc.) are not expected to read ACT.

## What is in ACT

* [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) defines the requirements for testing rules, to guide the developers of ACT Rules
* [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Repository](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act-rules/) provides a set of vetted testing rules following the ACT Rules Format specification

## Objectives of ACT

* **Establish consensus interpretation of accessibility requirements (Primarily WCAG) around a core set of test rules** &mdash; currently there are varying and often contradictory interpretations of WCAG, which causes confusion and slows down the implementation of web accessibility
* **Provide transparency and comparability of test tools and implementations** &mdash; currently test tools employ their own often proprietary interpretations of WCAG, making test results difficult to interpret, combine, and compare
* **Enable increased tool support by documenting structured testing procedures** &mdash; establishing a common base of test rules allows tool developers to focus on increasing tool support, to reduce the amount of manual testing required

## Status of ACT Rules Format 1.0

[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) is currently a stable draft called W3C Proposed Recommendation (see [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/) for more background). A collection of [ACT Rules](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/) conforming to this specification is being developed through the [W3C ACT Rules Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/).

### Technical document format

The ACT Rules Format follows the W3C format for technical specifications, which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. Most WAI specifications have a link at the top to the Table of Contents.

## Who develops ACT

The [ACT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/) of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) develops the normative ACT Rules Format 1.0 specification and supporting materials needed to implement the standard.

The [W3C ACT Rules Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/) (formerly Auto-WCAG CG) develops non-normative test rules according to the normative specification. Approved test rules will be published in the [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Repository](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act-rules/).

Opportunities for contributing to ACT and other WAI work are introduced in [Participating in WAI](/WAI/participation).
